description: Learn how to create integration tests for your app when using Expo Router.

Expo Router relies on your file system, which can present challenges when setting up mocks for integration tests. Expo Router's submodule, `expo-router/testing-library`, is a set of testing utilities built on top of the popular [`@testing-library/react-native`](https://callstack.github.io/react-native-testing-library/) and allows you to quick create minimal in-memory Expo Router apps, pre-configured for testing.

## Configuration

Before you proceed, ensure you've set up `jest-expo` according to the [Unit Testing](/develop/testing) and [`@testing-library/react-native`](https://callstack.github.io/react-native-testing-library/docs/getting-started).

## renderRouter

`renderRouter` extends the functionality of [`render`](https://callstack.github.io/react-native-testing-library/docs/api#render) to simplify testing with Expo Router. It returns the the same query object as [`render`](https://callstack.github.io/react-native-testing-library/docs/api#render), and is compatible with [`screen`](https://callstack.github.io/react-native-testing-library/docs/api#screen), allowing you to use the standard [query API](https://callstack.github.io/react-native-testing-library/docs/api-queries) to locate components.

`renderRouter` accepts the same [options](https://callstack.github.io/react-native-testing-library/docs/api#render-options) as `render` and introduces an additional option `initialRoute`, which sets an initial route for simulating deep-linking.

### Inline file-system mock

`renderRouter(mock: Record<string, ReactComponent>, options: RenderOptions)`

`renderRouter` can provide inline-mocking of a file system by passing an object to this function as the first parameter. The keys of the object are the mock filesystem paths. **Do not use leading relative (`./`) or absolute (`/`) notation when defining these paths and exclude file extension.**

```tsx app.test.tsx
import { renderRouter, screen } from 'expo-router/testing-library';

it('my-test', async () => {
  const MockComponent = jest.fn(() => <View />);

  renderRouter(
    {
      index: MockComponent,
      'folder/a': MockComponent,
      '(group)/b': MockComponent,
    },
    {
      initialRoute: '/folder/a',
    }
  );

  expect(screen).toHavePathname('/folder/a');
});
```

### Path to a directory

`renderRouter(fixturePath: string, options: RenderOptions)`

`renderRouter` can accept a directory path to mock an existing fixture. Ensure that the provided path is relative to the current test file.

```tsx app.test.js
it('my-test', async () => {
  const MockComponent = jest.fn(() => <View />);
  renderRouter('./my-test-fixture');
});
```

### Path to a directory, with overrides

`renderRouter({ appDir: string, overrides: Record<string, ReactComponent>}, options: RenderOptions)`

For more intricate testing scenarios, `renderRouter` can leverage both directory path and inline-mocking methods simultaneously. The `appDir` parameter takes a string representing a pathname to a folder. The overrides parameter is an inline mock that can be used to override specific paths within the `appDir`. This combination allows for fine-tuned control over the mock environment.

## Jest matchers

The following matches have been added to `expect` and can be used to asset values on `screen`.

### `toHavePathname()`

Assert the current pathname against a given string. The matcher uses the value of the [`usePathname` hook](/router/reference/hooks/#usepathname) on the current `screen`

```tsx app.test.ts
expect(screen).toHavePathname('/my-router');
```

### `toHaveSegments`

Assert the current segments against an array of strings. The matcher uses the value of the [`useSegments` hook](/router/reference/hooks/#usesegments) on the current `screen`

```tsx app.test.ts
expect(screen).toHaveSegments(['[id]']);
```

### `useLocalSearchParams`

Assert the current local search parameters against an object. The matcher uses the value of the [`useLocalSearchParams` hook](/router/reference/hooks/#uselocalsearchparams) on the current `screen`

```tsx app.test.ts
expect(screen).useLocalSearchParams({ first: 'abc' });
```

### `useGlobalSearchParams`

Assert the current screen's pathname that matches a value. Compares using the value of [`useGlobalSearchParams`](/router/reference/hooks/#useglobalsearchparams) hook.

Assert the current global search parameters against an object. The matcher uses the value of the [`useGlobalSearchParams` hook](/router/reference/hooks/#useglobalsearchparams) on the current `screen`

```tsx app.test.ts
expect(screen).useGlobalSearchParams({ first: 'abc' });
```
